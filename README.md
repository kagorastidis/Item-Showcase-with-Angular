# Item-Showcase-with-Angular

This is a simple item showcase (using cats) , made for educational purposes(learning Angular JS). 
I used ng-repeat directive to populate a list of cats (image,title,location etc).

What I intend to do next :

Experiment with ng-route , to give each cat a view.
Try google maps API to make a "locator" for each Cat.

Feel free to fork and expand the current functionality.
